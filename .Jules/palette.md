## 2024-05-22 - Sidebar Filter Accessibility
**Learning:** Visual-only filters (color swatches) and list-based navigation often lack semantic meaning and keyboard interaction in this codebase.
**Action:** Always refactor string-based filter arrays into object arrays to support `aria-label` and `title`. Convert non-interactive list items to `<button>` elements for keyboard accessibility.

## 2026-01-24 - Navbar Icon Buttons
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons are frequently left without `aria-label` in this codebase, making them invisible to screen readers. Also, corruption in these files can be subtle (missing closing tags).
**Action:** When working on navigation components, always verify icon buttons have accessible names and ensure component syntax integrity.

## 2026-01-26 - Skip Link Navigation
**Learning:** Fixed navigation bars overlay content, so skip links must use z-index > 50 and absolute positioning to be visible when focused.
**Action:** Implement "Skip to content" links with `z-[60]` and `focus:absolute` to ensure they appear above sticky headers. Add `tabIndex="-1"` to the target container to fix focus management bugs.

## 2026-01-26 - Clickable Card Pattern
**Learning:** When making an entire card clickable using a stretched link (`after:absolute after:inset-0`), any nested interactive elements (like buttons) must be explicitly positioned (e.g., `relative`) and z-indexed higher than the link overlay to remain clickable.
**Action:** Use `z-10` for the card link overlay and `z-20` for nested actions. Ensure the card container is `relative` or `article`.
## 2026-04-25 - Transient Success State Accessibility
**Learning:** Relying solely on changing the 'aria-label' on a button when its state temporarily changes (like an 'Added' success state) is unreliable for screen readers. Using an `aria-live="polite"` visually hidden region that dynamically inserts text (e.g. '${product.name} added to cart') provides a much more robust and understandable experience for screen reader users.
**Action:** Use an `aria-live` region combined with `setTimeout` (managed carefully via `useEffect` with proper cleanup) to reliably announce transient success states to assistive technologies without interrupting the user's flow.

## 2026-04-26 - Card Link Focus Indicator
**Learning:** When using the "stretched link" pattern (`after:absolute after:inset-0`) to make an entire card clickable, applying standard focus utilities (`focus-visible:ring-2`) to the anchor tag doesn't work correctly because the pseudo-element covers the area and the focus ring isn't visible or aligned with the card's boundaries.
**Action:** Apply focus utilities directly to the pseudo-element using `focus-visible:after:ring-2` and ensure you match the card's border radius (e.g., `after:rounded-xl`) so the focus ring correctly outlines the entire clickable area.
