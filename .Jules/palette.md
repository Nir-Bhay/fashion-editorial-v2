## 2024-05-22 - Sidebar Filter Accessibility
**Learning:** Visual-only filters (color swatches) and list-based navigation often lack semantic meaning and keyboard interaction in this codebase.
**Action:** Always refactor string-based filter arrays into object arrays to support `aria-label` and `title`. Convert non-interactive list items to `<button>` elements for keyboard accessibility.

## 2026-01-24 - Navbar Icon Buttons
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons are frequently left without `aria-label` in this codebase, making them invisible to screen readers. Also, corruption in these files can be subtle (missing closing tags).
**Action:** When working on navigation components, always verify icon buttons have accessible names and ensure component syntax integrity.
